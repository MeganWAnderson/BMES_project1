This repository includes the code and technical reports associated with the Bioengineering Measurment, Experimentation, and Statistics Midterm Project.

The goal of this project was to complete a statistical analysis comparing two provided data sets. These data sets included anthropometry data from NHANES which is a database was developed by the USA Center for Disease 
Control including 5,019 USA civilians had their age, sex (binary categorization), height, and weight recorded. The other data set provided included anthropometry data from ANSUR which is a database developed by the USA Army 
in 2012. 6,068 active-duty army service members had their age, sex (binary categorization), height, and weight recorded. The overarching goal of this project was to analyze the data in light of a Bioengineering topic. 

For this project, I elected to analyze the data in light of Airplane Seat Design, as the development of military and commercial aircrafts varies signficantly due to the goals of each industry and the anthropometric data 
described above. In order to analyze this data, the two data sets were tested to ensure they fit a normal distribtuion, and graphical comparisons were made to determine the difference in variance, range, and mean of each 
age group in the two data sets. This analysis was done using MATLAB software.
